# DISCORD-WELPBOT

Discord bot meant for my own personal use
Can be used for any server but config variables need to be set

## Steps to build
1. Install node (if not installed already)
2. Install yarn, `npm install yarn -g` (if not done already)
3. `yarn` to install packages
4. `yarn discord` to start the bot
