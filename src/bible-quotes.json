hail,\nAnd their sycomore-trees with frost.\nHe gave over their\ncattle also to the hail,\nAnd their flocks to hot thunderbolts.\nHe cast upon them\nthe fierceness of his anger,\nWrath, and indignation, and trouble,\nA band of angels of evil.\nHe made a path for\nhis anger;\nHe spared not their soul from death,\nBut gave their life over to the pestilence,\nAnd smote all the\nfirst-born

not;\nBut the sea overwhelmed their enemies.\nAnd he brought them\nto the border of his sanctuary,\nTo this mountain, which his right hand had gotten.\nHe drove out the\nnations also before them,\nAnd allotted them for an inheritance by line,\nAnd made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.\nYet they tempted and\nrebelled against the Most High God,\nAnd kept not his testimonies;\nBut turned

his\nadversaries backward:\nHe put them to a perpetual reproach.\nMoreover he refused\nthe tent of Joseph,\nAnd chose not the tribe of Ephraim,\nBut chose the tribe\nof Judah,\nThe mount Zion which he loved.\nAnd he built his\nsanctuary like the heights,\nLike the earth which he hath established for ever.\nHe chose David also\nhis servant,\nAnd took him from the sheepfolds:\nFrom following
